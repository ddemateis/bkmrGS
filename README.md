The R package `bkmrGS` implements Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) with group-separable kernels, a method for estimating effect modification of a categorical variable in the BKMR framework. The methods in this package build upon the work in the bkmr package. 

You can install the latest released version of `bkmr` from GitHub with:
```R
