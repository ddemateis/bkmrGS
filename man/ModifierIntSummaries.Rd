  Z = NULL,
  X = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object containing the results returned by a the \code{kmbayes} function}

\item{y}{a vector of outcome data of length \code{n}.}

\item{Z}{an \code{n}-by-\code{M} matrix of predictor variables to be included in the \code{h} function. Each row represents an observation and each column represents an predictor.}

\item{X}{an \code{n}-by-\code{K} matrix of covariate data where each row represents an observation and each column represents a covariate. Should not contain an intercept column.}

\item{modifier}{a vector categorical values of length \code{n} that may modify the exposure-response associations. Control level ordering by using class \code{factor}, or use default level orders with any vector class.}

\item{m.diff}{vector of two modifier values at which to compare the estimated \code{h} function}

\item{q.fixed}{vector of quantiles at which to calculate the summary}

\item{method}{method for obtaining posterior summaries at a vector of new points. Options are "approx" and "exact"; defaults to "approx", which is faster particularly for large datasets; see details}

\item{sel}{selects which iterations of the MCMC sampler to use for inference; see details}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the (posterior mean) estimate and posterior standard deviation of the overall risk measures
}
\description{
Compare estimated \code{h} function when all predictors are at a particular quantile to when all are at a second fixed quantile
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item If \code{method == "approx"}, the argument \code{sel} defaults to the second half of the MCMC iterations.
  \item If \code{method == "exact"}, the argument \code{sel} defaults to keeping every 10 iterations after dropping the first 50\% of samples, or if this results in fewer than 100 iterations, than 100 iterations are kept
