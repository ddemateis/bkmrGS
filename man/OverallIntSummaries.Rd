\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object containing the results returned by a the \code{kmbayes} function}

\item{y}{a vector of outcome data of length \code{n}.}

\item{Z}{an \code{n}-by-\code{M} matrix of predictor variables to be included in the \code{h} function. Each row represents an observation and each column represents an predictor.}

\item{X}{an \code{n}-by-\code{K} matrix of covariate data where each row represents an observation and each column represents a covariate. Should not contain an intercept column.}

\item{modifier}{a vector categorical values of length \code{n} that may modify the exposure-response associations. Control level ordering by using class \code{factor}, or use default level orders with any vector class.}

\item{which.z}{vector indicating which variables (columns of \code{Z}) for which the summary should be computed}

\item{qs}{vector of quantiles at which to calculate the overall risk summary}

\item{mod.diff}{a vector of two unique modifier values to compare the estimated \code{h} function}

\item{q.fixed}{a second quantile at which to compare the estimated \code{h} function}

\item{method}{method for obtaining posterior summaries at a vector of new points. Options are "approx" and "exact"; defaults to "approx", which is faster particularly for large datasets; see details. Only "exact" is supported now}

\item{sel}{logical expression indicating samples to keep; defaults to keeping the second half of all samples}

\item{z.names}{optional vector of names for the columns of \code{z}}

\item{...}{other arguments to pass on to the prediction function}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the (posterior mean) estimate and posterior standard deviation of the single-predictor risk measures
}
\description{
Compare the overall effect difference between groups for models with modification
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item If \code{method == "approx"}, the argument \code{sel} defaults to the second half of the MCMC iterations.
  \item If \code{method == "exact"}, the argument \code{sel} defaults to keeping every 10 iterations after dropping the first 50\% of samples, or if this results in fewer than 100 iterations, than 100 iterations are kept

\examples{
## First generate data set
y <- ex_data$y
Z <- ex_data$Z
modifier <- ex_data$X$Sex
X_full <- ex_data$X[,-2] #remove Sex from the covariate matrix because it is the modifier
X <- model.matrix(~., data=X_full)[,-1] #create design matrix to account for factor variables, remove the intercept column

## Fit model 
## Using only 10 iterations to make example run quickly
## Typically should use a large number of iterations for inference
set.seed(111)
fitkm <- kmbayes(y = y, Z = Z, modifier = modifier, X = X, iter = 10, verbose = FALSE)
