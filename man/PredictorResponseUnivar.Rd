\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object containing the results returned by a the \code{kmbayes} function}

\item{y}{a vector of outcome data of length \code{n}.}

\item{Z}{an \code{n}-by-\code{M} matrix of predictor variables to be included in the \code{h} function. Each row represents an observation and each column represents an predictor.}

\item{X}{an \code{n}-by-\code{K} matrix of covariate data where each row represents an observation and each column represents a covariate. Should not contain an intercept column.}

\item{modifier}{a vector categorical values of length \code{n} that may modify the exposure-response associations. Control level ordering by using class \code{factor}, or use default level orders with any vector class.}

\item{which.z}{vector identifying which predictors (columns of \code{Z}) should be plotted}

\item{which.mod}{vector of modifier values, either \code{c(0), c(1)}, or \code{c(0,1)}.}

\item{method}{method for obtaining posterior summaries at a vector of new points. Options are "approx" and "exact"; defaults to "approx", which is faster particularly for large datasets; see details. Only "exact" is supported now}

\item{ngrid}{number of grid points to cover the range of each predictor (column in \code{Z})}

\item{q.fixed}{vector of quantiles at which to fix the remaining predictors in \code{Z}}

\item{sel}{logical expression indicating samples to keep; defaults to keeping the second half of all samples}

\item{min.plot.dist}{specifies a minimum distance that a new grid point needs to be from an observed data point in order to compute the prediction; points further than this will not be computed}

\item{center}{flag for whether to scale the exposure-response function to have mean zero}

\item{z.names}{optional vector of names for the columns of \code{z}}

\item{...}{other arguments to pass on to the prediction function}
}
\value{
a long data frame with the predictor name, predictor value, posterior mean estimate, and posterior standard deviation

\examples{
## First generate data set
y <- ex_data$y
Z <- ex_data$Z
modifier <- ex_data$X$Sex
X_full <- ex_data$X[,-2] #remove Sex from the covariate matrix because it is the modifier
X <- model.matrix(~., data=X_full)[,-1] #create design matrix to account for factor variables, remove the intercept column

## Fit model 
## Using only 10 iterations to make example run quickly
## Typically should use a large number of iterations for inference
set.seed(111)
fitkm <- kmbayes(y = y, Z = Z, modifier = modifier, X = X, iter = 10, verbose = FALSE) 
pred.resp.univar <- PredictorResponseUnivar(fit = fitkm, method = "fullpost", q.fixed = 0.5)
