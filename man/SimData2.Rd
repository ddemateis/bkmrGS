\title{Simulate dataset with modifier}
\usage{
SimData2(opt = 1, SNR = 10, M = 2, bin_mod = 0, mod_DGM = T, sim_exp = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt}{Simulation scenario option: 1 for no modification, 2 for opposite effects, 3 for an effect in one group, and 4 for a scaled effect between groups}

\item{SNR}{signal-to-noise ratio}

\item{M}{number of exposures (1 to 3 supported)}

\item{bin_mod}{0 for group 1, 1 for group 2}

\item{mod_DGM}{indicator for including modifier in data generating mechanism}

\item{sim_exp}{indicator for using simulated exposure values and covariates. Not recommended for simulation}
}
