\title{Simulate dataset with modifier}
\usage{
SimData2(scenario = "none", SNR = 10, mod_DGM = T, sim_exp = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{scenario}{Simulation scenario option: "none" for no modification between two groups, "oneGroup" for one group effect out of two groups, "scaled2" for one groups having a scaled effect of the other group with 2 exposures, "scaled3" is the same but for 3 exposures, and "multi" for one group with no effect and the other two groups having a scaled effect}

\item{SNR}{signal-to-noise ratio}

\item{mod_DGM}{indicator for including modifier in data generating mechanism}

\item{sim_exp}{indicator for using simulated exposure values and covariates. Not recommended for simulation}
}
\description{
Simulate predictor, covariate, and continuous outcome data
